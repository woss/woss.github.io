# How to serve SPA with fallback on IPFS

Firstly we need to understand that the non file system routing ( prerendered pages and index.html ) will always fail when served from
IPFS and this is because the IPFS is not aware of it. Here is the simple and working example how to serve SPA with `index.html` as a fallback using Caddy server.

```
# General purpose ipfs gateway for Macula nodes;
*.g.macula.link {
	encode gzip
	# rewrite the main request
	rewrite * /ipfs/{labels.3}{uri}

	reverse_proxy {
		# proxy all to the IPFS gateway
		to http://127.0.0.1:8080

		# catch 404, this will happen when reloading page that has memory router and the path doesn't
		# exist on the IPFS
		@not_found status 404
		handle_response @not_found {
			# remove the {uri} because that is the error
			rewrite * /ipfs/{labels.3}/index.html
			reverse_proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080
		}
	}

	log {
		output file ./logs/g.log
		level DEBUG
	}
}
```

In order to test this, you need to have SPA that has internal routing, most of the routing in react is done like that, also Sveltekit has it with following settings:

```js
// routes/layout.ts
export const ssr = false;
export const prerender = false;

// svelte.config.js
import adapterStatic from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';
config.kit.adapter = adapterStatic({
  fallback: 'index.html',
});
```
