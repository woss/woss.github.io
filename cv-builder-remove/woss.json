        "Jack-of-all-trades when it comes to web development. I have more than 16 years of development and more that 10 years leading various team sizes in different countries and remotely. A full-stack ( this means I know multiple programming languages, and I am comfortable doing pretty much any task from frontend to backend, system maintenance, DEVOPS, and software system architecture ) developer, CTO, and problem solver extraordinaire with rich IT background.",
        "I enjoy learning and doing the necessary things myself when there is a need for it. This has led me to have the ability to fill multiple roles in an organization and to understand and apply a wide range of technologies for given tasks. This includes building the product from the ground up, including APIs, frontend, and system administration.",
        "I enjoy working at a free pace, but sometimes, if needed, 9-5 isn't that bad. I can put the necessary time into solving any problem I'm facing, no matter how tough and frustrating is. When I get the time to think of a problem properly I can come up with creative new suggestions on how to get the necessary results.",
        "I take pride in my ability to choose the right tool for the job, deciding when a homegrown solution is needed and when a 3rd party solution is much more cost-effective. I don't choose technologies just because I have a history with them, or because \"everyone uses them\", I choose technologies because they are perfect for the job."
